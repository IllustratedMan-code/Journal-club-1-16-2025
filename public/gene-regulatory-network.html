      A gene regulatory network, or gene transcription network shows the
      relationship between proteins called transcription factors and the
      transcription of genes.

      A simple transcriptional regulatory network. Sigma factors are analogous
      to general transcription factors found in eukaryotes, particularly TFIIB
      (which aids in assembly of the pre-initiation complex). Arrows show an
      activating/enhancing effect the perpendicular lines show an
      inhibitory/repressive effect.
